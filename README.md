👋 Hello World! 

🌱 Always looking for projects that aim to do something good for other humans and nature and can make my eyes sparkle ✨ Since 2020 I am working at cloud computing field leveraging infrastructure with IaC,
drafting architecture and injecting my emotion into green field scenario projects. (You may see nothing of this here... I must have extra Github Account for work :wink:)

🙏 GitOps, DevOps and scrum as a mantra.
📫 You can find me at linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/mmgarciapelaez/
